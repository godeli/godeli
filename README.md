# GoDeli
### Goals

Push a static site template for a no-frills deli menu, hours, location.

* Minimalist design that makes it easy to read the menu quickly.
* Easy-to-understand deployment instructions (github pages, gitlab pages, netlify, heroku, etc)
* Add a few examples and a demo

### Reason

When traveling for work, I find a lot of little diners/delis/etc that seem to have hidden their menu and hours in  D. B. Cooper's duffel bag. 

Having built and liquidated an online food ordering app in 2013, 
I know that these sort of places have razor-thin margins. Its why I liquidated the asset. With that in mind, I'm slinging together this boilerplate for a few places that I would like to have a menu in a place that isn't the predatory review sites. 

**TL:DR:** I think its silly to keep a drawer of paper takeout menus. This is my personal fix.
